# Learning Projects

This is a repository that contains all of the projects I have created while learning to become a front-end engineer. 



## HTML/CSS

Most content inside of the HTML/CSS directory is based on the knowledge I gained from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) 
or [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). 


### freecodecamp

Freecodecamp provides users with interactive courses to learn to code and receive certifications. Each course 
assigns tasks and projects that must pass UI tests. To receive my Responsive Web Design Certification, I had to 
complete 15 guided projects and 5 independent projects. 

Once I completed the independent projects, I relocated my code to this repository. Additionally, I recreated a few 
of the guided projects for better retention.

### theOdinProject

The Odin Project is another hands-on experience for aspiring web developers. Students taking advantage of this free
source are provided with articles, videos, exercises, projects, and a community to freely collaborate. The Odin 
Project calls its users to take more control of their own learning and even encourages them to contribute to the 
Odin Project itself. 

Though the Odin Project does not present certifications, it teaches students how to make their work virtually accessible
in GitHub for potential employers.
