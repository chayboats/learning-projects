// An array is a list-like object that can store multiple values
// Syntax: [value, value, value, etc...]

//Indexes
// Each value in an array is assigned a number called an index.
// Because this information is being processed by a computer, the first number is not 1
// This is how a human would count
// Computers count with the first number being 0
// In the following example 16 has an index of 0
// 45 has an index of 1
// 18 has an index of 2
// 29 has an index of 3
// 32 has an index of 4

const playerHomeRuns = [16, 45, 18, 29, 32];

// Accessing info in an array
// Syntax: variablename[indexNumber]

// Challenge: Create a constant with the name roysHomeRuns 
// and set it to the value of 29 from playerHomeRuns[]

const roysHomeRuns = playerHomeRuns[3];


//
