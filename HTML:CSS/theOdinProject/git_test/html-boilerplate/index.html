    <h1>My First Webpage</h1>
    <p>Technically this is not my first webpage. It is just my first one on the Odin Project!</p>
    <p><strong>I know how to make some text bold</strong></p>
    <p><em>I know how to make text italicized.</em></p>
    <h2>I can even make the headers smaller.</h2>
    <h3>And smaller.</h3>
    <h4>And smaller.</h4>
    <h5>And still smaller.</h5>
    <p><strong><em>I can even make text bold and italicized.</em></strong></p>
    <!-- 
      I did forget about the commenting thing though. 
      At least I forgot how to do it. I'm sure it's in my notes though. 
      I should probably use it more.

    <ol>
      <li>I already know how to do this, but the practice won't hurt.</li>
      <li>I am glad that I am able to quickly fly through these lessons.</li>
      <li>If I finish these lessons <strong><em>TOO</em></strong> quickly, I will probably go back to practice git.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Now here is my unordered list:</h3>
